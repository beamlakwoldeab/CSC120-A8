Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a robot that has all of the functionalities listed in the interface.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I did not implement any additional methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Working on this assignment was very interesting and I got to practice a lot of my previous coding knowledge through it. What worked is that I was able to implement most of the functionality, but I wasn't able to figure out how to make the "fly" method work fully. I hope to work on it further and resubmit later if I get the time.
